# AJAOne
AJAOne MQTT Sensor device

Most of the libraries used within the AJAOne code can be found in the Arduino Library Manager, with the exeption of "Nickstuff" and "i2cscanner" that 
are located here on my GIT Page.

Special thanks to Seon over at https://unexpectedmaker.com for the DotStar library (TinyPICO.h) that I am using to drive the RGB LED.  This can also be 
found in the Arduino Library Manager.

Cheers!

Nick Tucker
